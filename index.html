      TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American electric vehicle and clean
      energy company based in Palo Alto, California, United States. Tesla
      designs and manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage from home
      to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and
      services. In 2020, Tesla had the most sales of battery electric vehicles
      and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 16% of the plug-in market (which
      includes plug-in hybrids) and 23% of the battery-electric (purely
      electric) market. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company
      develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United
      States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of
      battery energy storage systems, with 3 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in
      2020. Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla
      Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical
      engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a US$6.5 million investment,
      X.com co-founder Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company
      and its chairman. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the
      purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and
      energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began
      production of its first car model, the Roadster, in 2009. This was
      followed by the Tesla Model S sedan in 2012, the Tesla Model X SUV in
      2015, the Tesla Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Tesla Model Y crossover in
      2020. The Tesla Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car
      worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1
      million units globally.[7] Tesla's global vehicle sales were 499,550 units
      in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the previous year. Tesla has been the
      subject of several lawsuits and controversies arising from statements and
      acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of creative accounting,
      whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, and unresolved and
      dangerous technical problems with their products. In September 2021, the
      National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to
      submit data pertaining to all sold US vehicles equipped with Autopilot.

        The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by
        Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[8] Eberhard and Tarpenning served
        as CEO and CFO, respectively.[9] Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car
        manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core
        technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary
        motor".[10] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months
        later.[8] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million in series
        A funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk, who had received $100
        million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk
        became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest
        shareholder of Tesla.[8][11][9] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004
        as Chief Technical Officer.[8] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by
        Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard,
        Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves
        co-founders.[12]
