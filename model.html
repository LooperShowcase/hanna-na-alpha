        The Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback produced by
        Tesla, Inc. It was introduced on June 22, 2012.[12] It received a major
        refresh in June 2021. Tesla positions the Model S as its flagship. In
        2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly
        new-car-sales ranking in any country, leading twice in Norway, in
        September and December 2013[13][14][15][16] and in Denmark in December
        2015.[17] Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018.[18][19][20][21]
        The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015
        and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model 3.[22][23][24] In
        an early review of the Model S, Consumer Reports declared, "This car
        performs better than anything we've ever tested before. Let me repeat
        that: Not just the best electric car, but the best car. It does just
        about everything really, really well."[25] In their Owner Satisfaction
        survey owners have consistently rated Teslas at, or near, the top
        rankings.[26] In 2019, Motor Trend named the 2013 Tesla Model S the
        ultimate "Car of the Year" over the magazine's entire 70-year
        history.[27]

        The Model 3 is an electric fastback mid-size four-door sedan developed
        by Tesla.[7] The Model 3 Standard Range Plus version delivers an
        EPA-rated all-electric range of 262 miles (422 km) and the Long Range
        version delivers 353 miles (568 km).[8] According to Tesla, the Model 3
        carries full self-driving hardware, with periodic software updates
        adding functionality.[9][10][11] Limited production of the Model 3 began
        in mid-2017, with the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly
        line on July 7, 2017.[12][13][14] The official launch and delivery of
        the first 30 cars took place on July 28.[15] In October 2021, Hertz car
        rental ordered 100,000 full-price Model 3 cars for its rental
        fleet.[16][17] The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more
        people than previous models by Tesla. Since early 2020, the Model 3 is
        the best-selling electric car in world history,[18] and, in June 2021,
        became the first electric car to pass the 1 million global sales
        milestone.[19] The Model 3 has been the world's top selling plug-in
        electric car (PEV) for three years running, from 2018 to
        2020.[20][21][22] It has also been the best-selling PEV in the United
        States for three consecutive years, 2018 to 2020,[23][24][25] the top
        selling PEV in Europe in 2019,[26] and the best-selling PEV in China in
        2020.[27]

      <li>Model X</li>

        The Tesla Model X is a mid-size all-electric luxury crossover made by
        Tesla, Inc. The vehicle is notable in that it uses falcon-wing doors for
        passenger access. The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan
        platform of the Tesla Model S. The Model X has an EPA size class as an
        SUV,[7] and shares ~30% of its content with the Model S, half of the
        originally planned ~60%, and weighs about 10 percent more. Both the
        Model X and Model S are being produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont,
        California. The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in
        Hawthorne, California on February 9, 2012.[11][12] First deliveries of
        the Model X began in September 2015.[13] After one full year on the
        market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh among the world's
        best-selling plug-in cars.[14] As of April 12, 2021, the Model X is only
        available as the Long Range with an estimated EPA range of 360.4 miles
        (580.0 km) and the Plaid model with an estimated EPA range of 339.9
        miles (547.0 km).[15][16] Both come with Tesla's Autopilot driver
        assistance system.[17]

      <li>Model Y</li>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Tesla Model Y is an electric compact crossover utility vehicle (CUV)
        by Tesla, Inc. Tesla unveiled it in March 2019,[2] started production at
        its Fremont plant in January 2020,[3] and started deliveries on March
        13, 2020.[4] It is the second vehicle based on the Model 3 sedan
        platform.[5] The Model Y shares an estimated 75% of its parts with the
        Tesla Model 3,[6] which includes a similar interior design and electric
        powertrain. Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a
        seven-passenger seating capacity.[7][8][9] The Model Y fills a smaller
        and less expensive segment than the full-sized Tesla Model X.[10] There
        were four planned powertrain configurations for the Model Y: Standard
        Range Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD), Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, Long Range
        with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD), and Performance (with Dual Motor
        All-Wheel Drive).[11][12] The Long Range AWD model and the Performance
        model are currently being delivered.[13] The Standard Range RWD
        configuration was initially canceled in July 2020, due to the range (230
        miles EPA) being unacceptably low to Musk, but was orderable as of
        January 2021 (with 244 miles of EPA range).[14][15] By February 7, 2021,
        the Long Range RWD appears to have been cancelled.[16]
